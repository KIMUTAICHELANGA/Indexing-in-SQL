Indexing Strategies
Composite Indexing: Indexing multiple columns together to save space and memory, enabling multiple filter applications efficiently.
Reasons for Composite Indexing: Space-saving, memory conservation by consolidating individual column indexes.
Usage Considerations: Organize most frequently accessed columns first, prioritize columns with higher cardinality (more unique values).
MySQL Limitation: Supports composite indexes up to 16 columns.
Sorting Techniques
Optimizing Sorting: Avoid unnecessary sorting operations to enhance query performance.
Index Utilization for Sorting: Leverage index sorting instead of file sorting for improved efficiency.
Sort Optimization Principle: Prefer sorting based on indexed columns, avoiding unnecessary file sorting.
Full-Text Search Optimization
Prefix Indexes: Utilize limited character indexing for string and text columns to improve search efficiency.
Optimizing Full-Text Searches: Use MATCH function in full-text search queries, applying relevance-based filtering for improved results.
Full-Text Search Modes: Employ Boolean mode for advanced search functionalities, including phrase inclusion and exclusion.
Query Optimization
Index-Based Filtering and Sorting: Utilize indexes for efficient filtering and sorting operations to minimize query cost.
File Sort Avoidance: Prioritize index-based sorting methods to reduce query execution time and resource consumption.
Monitoring Query Performance
Cost Analysis: Monitor query cost metrics to assess resource utilization and performance efficiency.
These guidelines aim to enhance database performance by optimizing indexing strategies, sorting techniques, and query execution. Regular monitoring and adjustment of these practices contribute to improved query efficiency and overall system performance.
